# DICTIONARY APP

Overview:
I created this python applicaion to make a user-friendly dictionary for daily use and referncing.

How to use:
>Run the app in the command line
>A prompt will appear asking you for the word you need the definition of
>Input the word and press ENTER
	>If the entered word is wrong will prompt a similar word
	>Will ask if it is applicable (Y/N)
	>Enter the choice
>Will output the desired definition

Features:
>This program is semi-smart. It will prompt a similar word when an error is made by the user while trying to input a name. 
Hence, not just lame dictionary app.

What I learnt from it?
>In the 'difflib' module the 'get_close_matches' is a pretty powerful yet simple code. Might have many other uses outside the dictionary for getting close matches.
